## Usage

The "usage information" in a README file is the section that explains how to use the project or software described in the README.  It's a crucial part of the documentation because it provides practical instructions and examples for users.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines in a README file are a set of rules and instructions that outline how others can contribute to a project.  They're essential for open-source projects or any collaborative effort because they ensure that contributions are valuable, consistent, and easy to integrate.  A well-defined contribution guide helps maintain project quality and makes it easier for potential contributors to get involved

## Tests

Test instructions in a README file explain how to run the tests for a project.  This is a crucial part of the documentation, especially for developers and contributors, as it ensures that changes to the code don't introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.  Clear test instructions help maintain code quality and make it easier for others to verify the correctness of the project.
